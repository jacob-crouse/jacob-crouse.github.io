## Jacob Crouse's Resume Website
My name is Jacob Crouse and I thought it would be a fun challenge to create my own website. As it turns out, though, you have to be pretty creative to style your own website, so I decided to let the people creative people help me out with that. I found [this](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/) great template on the Bootstrap website, and all I had to do was input my information in the html file and make it my own; the template did all the css and javascript for me, so there was no need for me to spend all my free time learning not only how to write css and js, but how to make it look <i>good</i>.  

I really appreciate what the people over at Bootstrap are doing. They've been able to make web development accessable to those of us who don't know how to break down an image and determine what makes it look good and bad. The websites I've created in the past have all looked like they had come straight out of the 90's with minimal styling and poorly-chosen fonts. With Bootstrap making all the hard decisions, I've been free to focus on the content of my resume over the outward visual quality.
